It was a great opportunity that allowed me to deal with aspects of the IT world such as database administration, servers, network infrastructure of the two company offices. Search for suppliers, materials, creation of new network infrastructures (new asterisk telephone switchboard and related telephones, new cloud machine park) and the convergence of all business technologies. I was able to propose solutions to make the work of all employees more efficient and halve IT costs."
